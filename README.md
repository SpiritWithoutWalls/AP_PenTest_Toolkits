# AP_PenTest_Toolkits
Automation Tools related to Access Point for Penetration Testing

## AP.sh

```
DHCP Server / Access Point with Internet Connection
Usage: ./AP.sh (-b NIC1[,NIC2,...] | -i NIC1) [OPTION...] | [-h]
  -h, --help                  Display this help menu
  -b, --bridge (NIC1, ...)    The network interfaces you want to bridge together and assign IP addresses on
  -i, --interface TARGET_NIC  The network interface your DHCP server is on
  -s, --source NET_NIC        The network interface you have Internet connection on
  -g, --gateway TARGET_GW     IP address of the gateway your DHCP server's going to use (default: 10.0.0.1)
  -c, --conf-dir CONF_DIR     The direcotry for you Config files dnsmasq.conf & hostapd.conf (default: ./)
  -p, --promisc               Enable promiscuous mode to intercept and read each network packet that arrives
Prerequisites:
  Programs: iptables, dnsmasq, stdbuf, hostapd
```

## DHCP_CmdInjection.sh

```
DHCP Hostname / Domain-name / SSID Command Injection
Usage: ./DHCP_CmdInjection.sh (-H|-D|-S) (-b NIC1[,NIC2,...] | -i NIC1) [[-p WORDLIST] [OPTION...] | [-h]]
  -h, --help              Display this help menu
  -H, --host              Hostname Command Injection (Targeting DHCP server)
  -D, --domain            Domain-name Command Injection (Targeting DHCP client)
  -S, --SSID              SSID Command Injection (Targeting AP client)
  -p, --payload WORDLIST  The file with commands you want to inject (default: ./cmd.txt)
  -n, --number ASSIGNED   How many hosts you want to assign IP to at a time
                          (default: 1, only used along with -D or -S assigned)
  -d, --delay PERIOD      The time (in seconds) to wait before releasing the IP address after each attack
                          (default: 10 sec)
  (Options supported in AP.sh (-b, -i, -s, -g, -c) could also be assigned)
Prerequisites:
  Programs: iptables, dnsmasq, stdbuf, hostapd
  AP.sh version >= v3.1
  AP.sh must be placed in the same folder
